Comparing the execution speed of Go and Python when running a basic bubble sort algorithm

I will be comparing the execution speed of Go and Python when running a basic bubble sort algorithm. I will be using the same array of 100,000 random integers for both languages. I will use as close to the same code and logic as possible in both languages to ensure a fair comparison.
